# Project Title:  From-Articles-to-Insights-Building-a-Text-Summarization-System
## Description
This project aims to create a system capable of summarizing lengthy articles, blogs, or news into concise summaries. Using the CNN/Daily Mail Dataset, we implement both extractive and abstractive summarization techniques. Extractive summarization is implemented using libraries like spaCy, while abstractive summarization leverages pre-trained transformer models like BERT or GPT from HuggingFace's `transformers` library.

- Build a summarization system capable of generating concise summaries from long texts.
- Implement both extractive and abstractive summarization techniques.
- Evaluate the quality of summaries using metrics like ROUGE scores and coherence analysis.

## Dataset Description and Preprocessing Steps

### Dataset Description
- **Dataset Name:** CNN/Daily Mail Dataset
- **Source:** [HuggingFace Datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cnn_dailymail) or [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/abisee/cnn-dailymail)
- **Features:**
  - **Articles:** Long-form textual content (news articles or stories).
  - **Highlights:** Short summaries provided by authors.
- **Target Variable:** Highlights (summaries).

### Preprocessing Steps
1. **Text Cleaning:**
   - Removed special characters, HTML tags, and unnecessary whitespace.
2. **Tokenization:**
   - Tokenized text into sentences and words using libraries like `nltk` or `spaCy`.
3. **Sentence Segmentation:**
   - Split articles into individual sentences for extractive summarization.
4. **Padding and Truncation:**
   - Ensured all input sequences were padded or truncated to a fixed length for transformer models.

## Extractive Summarization

### Implementation
- Used `spaCy` to identify key sentences based on their similarity to the overall document.
- Calculated sentence importance using TF-IDF scores or embeddings.

### Rationale
- Extractive summarization is computationally efficient and works well for structured documents like news articles.

---

## Abstractive Summarization

### Implementation
- Leveraged pre-trained transformer models like BERT or GPT from HuggingFace's `transformers` library.
- Fine-tuned the models on the CNN/Daily Mail Dataset to generate abstractive summaries.

### Rationale
- Abstractive summarization generates more natural and fluent summaries by paraphrasing content, making it suitable for creative writing or informal texts.

---

## Model Fine-Tuning

### Fine-Tuning Process
1. **Preprocessing for Transformers:**
   - Tokenized input data using the tokenizer associated with the pre-trained model.
2. **Training:**
   - Fine-tuned the model on the dataset using a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) approach.
3. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - Experimented with learning rates, batch sizes, and epochs to optimize performance.

---

## Evaluation Metrics

### Metrics Used
1. **ROUGE Scores:**
   - ROUGE-N (N-gram overlap), ROUGE-L (longest common subsequence), and ROUGE-W (weighted longest common subsequence).
2. **Coherence Analysis:**
   - Evaluated the fluency and readability of summaries using human evaluation.
3. **BLEU Score:**
   - Measured the overlap between generated summaries and reference summaries.

---

## Challenges Faced and Solutions

### Challenges
1. **Long Input Sequences:**
   - Transformer models struggled with very long input sequences due to memory constraints.
   - **Solution:** Truncated input sequences to a maximum length or used hierarchical models.
2. **Summary Coherence:**
   - Generated summaries sometimes lacked coherence or context.
   - **Solution:** Fine-tuned models on domain-specific datasets and used beam search during inference.
3. **Data Quality:**
   - Noisy or inconsistent data in the dataset affected model performance.
   - **Solution:** Cleaned and preprocessed the dataset thoroughly before training.

---

## Tools and Libraries
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries Used:**
  - `spaCy`: For extractive summarization.
  - `transformers` (HuggingFace): For abstractive summarization.
  - `nltk`, `re`: For text preprocessing.
  - `rouge-score`: For evaluating summary quality.
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook or Python IDE.
